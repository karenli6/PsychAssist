# PsychAssist
A virtual diagnostician for neurodevelopmental disorders.
Integrating psychological and medical fields, brain dysfunctions affect millions of people today through neuropsychiatric problems or impaired motor function. Using a database with records of symptoms from DSM-5, PsychAssist acts as a virtual diagnostician that specializes in neurodevelopmental disorders. 
The PsychAssist program database is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSMâ€“5) diagnostic book, a product from 10 years of collaboration between international psychologists. This project utilizes text input from a patient describing certain symptoms for psychological disorders.
Using sentiment analysis, PsychAssist will be able to detect certain moods from the description and reduce the input to concise key words. This ambiguity of the input is in the way the patient describes what he/she is feeling. Using the formatted database connected to the algorithm, the code will be able to use sentiment analysis to generate similarity computations and output a diagnosed disorder.
